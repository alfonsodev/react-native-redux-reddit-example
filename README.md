# Redux advance tutorial (react-native)  
This a version from the [original tutorial](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html)  

## What changes from react to react-native ?   
I tried to make as little changes as possible. Just the obvious changes to make it work, div, p, li tags  
were replace by View and Text. I use the native Picker so I didn't create components/Picker.js.
The package `isomorphic-fetch` is not needed as react-native comes with `fetch` out of the box.
